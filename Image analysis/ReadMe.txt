# Ant Movement Tracking and Interaction Detection

This folder contains seven analytic tools for tracking ants' movement and detecting interactions. The data outputs generated by these analytic tools are further used for the manuscript titled "Social Interactions Are Impacted by Food Availability, Food Type, and Group Size."

These seven MATLAB scripts should be executed in the local folder of BeeTag, which can be downloaded from [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_BEEtag_A_Low_Cost_Image_Based_Tracking_System_for_the_Study_of_Animal_Behavior_and_Locomotion_/1534065).

## Tracking

The MATLAB script 'Tracking' explores various thresholds within a pre-defined range to maximize the detection rate of Beetags. The output of this script is saved and used for subsequent analyses.

## AddlabelSpeed

The MATLAB script 'AddlabelSpeed' assigns labels from 1 to 4 to each tag's four corners. These labels are sorted based on their relative distances from the tag's center. These labels are used for further analyses, such as calibrating the heading direction of each ant in each frame. Additionally, ant speed at each frame is added to the output of 'tracking.m.'

## FrameSelectionForCalibration

The MATLAB script 'FrameSelectionForCalibration' counts the total occurrences of each ID being tracked over frames. It selects the frame where the maximum number of ants is being tracked for calibration point collection. This step requires human imputs.

## CalibrationPointsCollectionClicking

The MATLAB script 'CalibrationPointsCollectionClicking' collects relative distances from the clicking point at the head to two corners and the center of each Beetag on the chosen frame. These relative distances will be used to calibrate the direction and location of each ant's head in each frame.

## DistanceApproximation

The MATLAB script 'DistanceApproximation' randomly selects N frames and collects the distance between the heads of two ants engaged in trophallaxis.

## InterpolatingLocatingHeadBuildingNetworks

The MATLAB script 'InterpolatingLocatingHeadBuildingNetworks' uses the output of 'CalibrationPointsCollectionClicking.m' to locate each ant's head and create a distance matrix for each frame. This distance matrix is compared with the output of 'DistanceApproximation.m' to construct spatial proximity networks when the distance is less than the spatial proximity threshold.

## CompiledFile

The MATLAB script 'CompiledFile' defines the image directory, the number of ants, the starting frame, and the ending frame.
